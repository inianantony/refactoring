## Refactoring

# Step 1
Study the code a bit so that we can know the public interfaces the code expose
# Step 2
Cover the public interface with tests so that it can give us confidence when proceeding with refactoring
# Step 3 
Take baby steps in refactoring
# Step 4
commit the code and push when you see green on the tests
# Step 5 
Continue the refactoring
# Step 6
rollback the change if you took more than 5 mins for a change. usually if we take baby steps we should be in a safe zone on every move. If we are in a change for long time and coouldnt commit, then the action is fishy. Take a step back and think again. Things culd be done in a simple way
# Step 7
Your code should tell a story
# Step 8
I fell I have completed my refactoring when I can have a sence of feeling that my code is sharing a story
